![alt tag](http://buccaneer.io/content/images/2016/06/ionic.png)

### Starting Ionic ### 
***We are just testing out our ionic app***


***You will re-implement my Weather Service app to do two main things:***

1. Use the DarkSky API to recreate some of the data strings provided by Weather Underground
2. Read the list of cities from a file - you should be able to add or remove cities

***Remember that you'll need at least three API accounts for this:***

1. Google Maps API
2. Weather Underground API
3. DarkSky API


*Command to run ionic on C9*
```
ionic serve -p $PORT --nolivereload
```
